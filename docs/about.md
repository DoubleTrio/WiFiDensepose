## Motivation
Hi, I'm Kacey La, an undergraduate student researcher at [Ursinus College](https://www.ursinus.edu/). This website is meant to document my learnings in replicating the paper [Densepose From WiFi](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.00250.pdf). I will be doing an overview of my setup — information not covered in the paper which are essential to replicating it.  The information is a 8-week culmination of my ongoing work — all of which is condensed down into this website. I hope this website becomes great use for researchers, who like me, was mind-blown the first time reading this paper and had some rather complicated feelings on this matter.
